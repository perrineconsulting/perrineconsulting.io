        <h1>When Emotional Hot Spots Hijack Your Brain</h1>
        <p class="post-date">By Cindi Perrine | November 22, 2025</p>

        <p>
            We've known for a long time that different networks within our brain are responsible for different behaviors, experiences, and thoughts. This neurological perspective of thought and behavior is increasingly entering the coaching world under various frameworks, mainly focused on two areas within our brain: the **limbic system** and the **prefrontal cortex**.
        </p>

        <p>
            The limbic system is roughly the middle part of your brain, below the folded layers of your cerebral cortex but above your brain stem. I studied parts of the limbic system in graduate school, measuring the electrical responses in Rabbit brains while they were learning. Our research was rudimentary compared to what is possible today, but the area continues to interest scientists. There's a lot we don't know about how the brain works in all its beautiful complexity, but in a grossly simplistic way, many would describe the limbic as critical to learning, emotions, behavior (habits), and olfaction. Your **fight, flight, freeze, and fawn response** lives here. The limbic system will become a recurring topic in future writings, but I want to focus on emotions for this post.

            It begins with your brain taking inputs from your senses (pre-filtered, processed, and distorted before reaching you — again, another topic). Most of the inputs congregate in your **thalamus**, part of your limbic system. Here, your limbic system connects those inputs with memories and tries to construct a view of 'reality.' It's trying to figure out, through pattern recognition and predictive modeling, what's going on. Sometimes, an automatic behavior (habit) is triggered. Sometimes, you positively associate with the inputs and feel happy. But sometimes, a threat is detected, and your limbic system is now on high alert, telling you all kinds of things that may or may not be accurate. Remember, in our
